Give the sid (a number):9
Enter your name:1
give a letter y or n:y
Give the sid (a number):1
Enter your name:hj
give a letter y or n:3
The required dictionary-- {9: '1', 1: 'hj'}
The list will be used in further parts--
The required list-- [(9, '1'), (1, 'hj')]
Done!
----------------(b)------------------------
The dictionary we had-
{9: '1', 1: 'hj'}
now we have exchanged the key value pair but its not sorted-
{'1': 9, 'hj': 1}
The unsorted list--
[('1', 9), ('hj', 1)]
The sorted list--
[('1', 9), ('hj', 1)]
The sorted dictionary-
{'1': 9, 'hj': 1}
This is the dictionary sorted on the basis of name-
{9: '1', 1: 'hj'}
Done!
-----------------(c)-----------------
The list we made before will be used now-
[(9, '1'), (1, 'hj')]
now the list is sorted-
[(1, 'hj'), (9, '1')]
sorted dictionary based on sid- {1: 'hj', 9: '1'}
